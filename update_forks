How to update your forked repo with the original repo:

Option 1:
    You can perform a “Reverse Pull Request” on GitHub. A reverse pull request will follow the same steps as a regular
    pull request. However, in this case, your fork becomes the base and your colleague’s repo is the head.
    You can do it directly on GitHub by clicking on the “New pull request” button on your forked repo.
    Then, you need to change the base fork to your forked repo and the head fork to the original repo.
    Finally, you need to click on the “Create pull request” button.
    You can then merge the pull request.

Option 2:
    You can use the command line to update your forked repo with the original repo.
    First, you need to add the original repo as a remote.
    Then, you need to pull the original repo into your local repo.
    Finally, you need to merge the original repo into your forked repo.

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/jcorreia11/si.git
